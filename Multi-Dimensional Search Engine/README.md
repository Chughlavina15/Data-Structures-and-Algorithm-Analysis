Multi-dimensional search

Search Engine for a shopping mall
The search engine allows users to specify attributes of products that they are seeking, and shows products that have most of those attributes.  To make search efficient, the data is organized using appropriate data structures, such as balanced trees. 
The solution, called indexing in databases, is to create a new set of
references to the objects for each search field, and organize them to
implement search operations on that field efficiently.

Performed methods:
Insert item - storing price and the description list of the item
Find item
Delete item from storage
FindMaxandMinPrice
Remove items from inventory
