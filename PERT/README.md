PERT, or Program Evaluation and Review Technique

A project planning and control method that uses time as a variable to schedule, organize, 
and coordinate uncertain activities. 


Implemented PERT, that represents the tasks involved in a project and their relationships:

          1) Identify tasks: Create a list of all the tasks that need to be completed, 
          including which tasks are critical.

          
          2) Define dependencies: Consider how the tasks relate to each other.

          
          3) Estimate time: Calculate optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely time frames
          for each task.

          
          4) Create a network diagram: Use Activity on Nodes (AoN) notation to represent tasks as
          rectangles connected by arrows. The direction of the arrows indicates the sequence of tasks.

          
          5) Calculate dates: Determine start and early finish dates for each task, then calculate late 
          finish dates.

          
          6) Find the critical path: Identify the path in the network diagram where the early and late start 
          and finish dates match for each task. This path shows the tasks that take the longest to complete 
          and can help you develop a realistic timeline for the project.
