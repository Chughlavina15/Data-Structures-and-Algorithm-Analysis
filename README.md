Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis Projects

1)
Arithmetic Expression Evaluation: Developed algorithms using stacks and queues to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions, including conversion between infix, postfix, and expression trees with error handling.

2)
Multi-Dimensional Search Engine: Designed a search engine for a shopping mall utilizing balanced trees, hashmaps, and hashsets for efficient product indexing and retrieval.

3)
PERT Algorithm: Implemented a PERT algorithm in Java for project task analysis, calculating optimal completion time and critical paths using Depth First Search and Topological Sorting.

4)
Binary Search Tree and AVL Tree Implementations: Developed a Binary Search Tree (BST) with operations for node management and value retrieval. Extended to an AVL Tree with balancing rotations and AVL-specific verification.
